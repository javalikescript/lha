lha is a light home automation application

## Overview

The lha application allows to
* enrich your existing gateway such as the [Hue](https://www.philips-hue.com/) bridge
* record and display historical device values such as temperature
* interact between incompatible protocols such as between _ZigBee_ and _Z-Wave_
* compose advanced automations using [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) scripts
* create your own [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) extensions

The lha engine manages the extensions including scripts, the things, the scheduler and a web server.
The engine records thing property values in dedicated time based log files.

It is a pure [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) application built around a scheduler and an HTTP server based on [luajls](https://github.com/javalikescript/luajls).
It exposes a [Web of Things](https://iot.mozilla.org/wot/) API.

The lha application could be run on small computers such as the _Raspberry PI_ or the _WD MyCloud_.
It could also be run on any _Linux_ distribution or _Windows_.
The application is small, around 5MB, and does not need any dependency.
