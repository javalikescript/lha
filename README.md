lha is a light home automation application

## Overview

The lha application could be run on small computers such as the Raspberry PI or the WD MyCloud.
It could also be run on any Linux distribution or Windows.

The application is built around a scheduler and an HTTP server based on [luajls](https://github.com/javalikescript/luajls).
It allows [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) extensions and [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) scripts.
It exposes a [Web of Things](https://iot.mozilla.org/wot/) API.
