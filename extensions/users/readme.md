This extension allows you to manage the access rights.

By default the engine can be used by anyone without any credentials.

You could add users and associated access rights.

The available access rights are:
* `read`: read things
* `write`: modify thing property values
* `configure`: add or modify things or extensions
* `administer`: start or stop the engine

Note: Take care to have at least one user with the `administer` or `configure` right.

You could restrict the access to logged users, users are redirected to a login page.
